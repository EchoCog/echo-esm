# ESM3 Cognitive Accounting Framework

A neural-symbolic cognitive architecture that adapts OpenCog-style cognitive computing concepts to ESM3 protein modeling tasks. This framework transforms traditional protein analysis into a cognitive system with learning, attention, reasoning, and evolutionary capabilities.

## Overview

The framework maps traditional accounting concepts to protein analysis:
- **Proteins → Cognitive Accounts**: Protein sequences become cognitive account representations
- **Amino Acids → Cognitive Transactions**: Individual amino acids become cognitive transactions  
- **Structures → Balance States**: Protein structures represent cognitive balance states
- **Functions → Performance Metrics**: Protein functions become cognitive performance metrics

## Core Components

## Installation

The framework is integrated into the ESM3 package:

```bash
# Install ESM3 with cognitive extensions
pip install -e .

# Run tests
python -m esm.cognitive.test_cognitive

# Run demonstration
python -m esm.cognitive.demo_cognitive
```

## Quick Start

```python
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein
from esm.cognitive import CognitiveAccountingFramework, CognitiveAccountType

# Initialize framework
framework = CognitiveAccountingFramework()

# Create protein
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MKLLVLLAIVCFGAA")

# Add to framework with cognitive features
cognitive_protein = framework.add_protein(
    protein, 
    CognitiveAccountType.ADAPTIVE | CognitiveAccountType.PREDICTIVE
)

# Enable learning
cognitive_protein.enable_learning()

# Run cognitive cycles
for _ in range(10):
    framework.run_cognitive_cycle()

# Generate validation proof
protein_id = list(framework.cognitive_proteins.keys())[0]
proof = framework.validate_protein_set([protein_id])
print(f"Validation confidence: {proof.confidence:.3f}")

# Make uncertainty-aware prediction
prediction = framework.predict_with_uncertainty(protein_id, "stability")
print(f"Stability: {prediction.prediction:.3f} ± {prediction.total_uncertainty:.3f}")

# Get system status
status = framework.get_system_status()
print(f"Cognitive cycles: {status['cycle_count']}")
```
